# Placeholder for global agent templates

This directory is for global agent templates that should be available to all apps in the ecosystem.
Currently empty but prepared for future use.

Agent templates placed here will be available to:
- Orchestrator_3_stream
- All other apps that implement hierarchical agent loading

Templates in app-specific directories will override global templates with the same name.
