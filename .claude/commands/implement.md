# Implement

Implement a solution following engineering best practices and coding standards.

## Variables

TASK_DESCRIPTION: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

- Analyze requirements from TASK_DESCRIPTION or issue
- Design solution following existing patterns
- Implement with proper error handling
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Follow codebase conventions
- Write production-quality code

## Workflow

1. **Understand Requirements** - Analyze what needs to be implemented
2. **Explore Codebase** - Use Grep/Glob to find relevant patterns
3. **Design Solution** - Plan technical approach
4. **Implement Code** - Write production-quality implementation
5. **Add Documentation** - Include comments and docstrings
6. **Validate** - Test implementation works correctly

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Use proper TypeScript/Python types
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Avoid SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize user data
- Follow OWASP security practices

### Testing Considerations
- Consider edge cases
- Handle error scenarios
- Validate boundary conditions
- Think about error messages

### Documentation
- Add function/method docstrings
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Reference related code

## Report

- Summarize implementation approach
- List files created/modified
- Highlight key decisions made
- Note any security considerations
- Suggest testing approach
