# Claude Models Overview

## Current Models

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** is recommended as the starting point, offering "the best balance of intelligence, speed, and cost for most use cases."

### Latest Model Comparison

The three current models serve different purposes:

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** ($3/$15 per million tokens input/output)
- Designed for complex agents and coding tasks
- 200K token context window (1M in beta)
- 64K max output tokens
- Supports extended thinking and priority tier access

**Claude Haiku 4.5** ($1/$5 per million tokens)
- The fastest option with near-frontier capabilities
- Same context and output specifications as Sonnet
- Most cost-effective for general tasks

**Claude Opus 4.1** ($15/$75 per million tokens)
- Specialized for complex reasoning
- Moderate latency, 32K max output tokens
- Premium performance for demanding applications

## Key Capabilities

All current models support:
- Text and image input processing
- Extended thinking for enhanced reasoning
- Multilingual support
- Vision capabilities
- Structured outputs
- Availability across Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI

## Migration Path

Anthropic recommends upgrading from Claude 3 models to Claude 4.5 variants to access improved intelligence and capabilities. Legacy models (Sonnet 4, Opus 4, Haiku 3.5) remain available but offer less performance than current versions.
