## Current Tasks

### ✅ Architecture Analysis Complete
- MCP protocol specifications documented
- Integration points identified
- Data flows mapped
- Service boundaries defined

### ✅ Infrastructure Design Complete
- Core server infrastructure created
- Directory structure established
- Development environment configured
- All essential components implemented:
  - Express server with TypeScript
  - MCP protocol implementation
  - Service registry and handlers
  - Authentication & JWT support
  - Rate limiting per agent/service
  - Metrics collection (Prometheus)
  - Health monitoring endpoints
  - Command parser for slash commands
  - Error handling system
  - Structured logging
  - Environment configuration

### Ready for Service Implementation
**Status**: Infrastructure complete, awaiting GO signal for PostgreSQL MCP implementation

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js v20 + TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Container**: Docker Alpine
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Winston

### Security Model
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting per agent
- SSL/TLS via Let's Encrypt
- Network isolation
- Secrets management

## Notes & Observations

### 2025-10-20
- ✅ Complete MCP Gateway infrastructure implemented
- ✅ Core server with TypeScript and Express
- ✅ Authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring
- ✅ 3 server-side MCPs implemented (PostgreSQL, Mem0, N8N)
- ✅ 4 local MCPs configured (Playwright, ShadCN, MagicUI, Taskmaster)
- ✅ Docker and PM2 deployment configurations ready
- ⏳ Cloudflare and GitHub MCPs pending (need API credentials)
- 🚀 Ready for testing and deployment

### Implementation Highlights
- **PostgreSQL MCP**: Full database operations with connection pooling
- **Mem0 MCP**: Memory storage and vector search integration
- **N8N MCP**: Workflow automation with execution tracking
- **Security**: JWT auth, per-agent rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, health checks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and architecture docs

---

## Blockers & Issues
- **Cloudflare MCP**: Needs API token and account ID
- **GitHub MCP**: Needs GitHub App credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Some credentials need to be configured before deployment

---

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` for local testing
4. Deploy with Coolify or Docker
5. Test all MCP services with slash commands
