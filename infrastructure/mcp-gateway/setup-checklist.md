## Current Tasks

### ✅ Architecture Analysis Complete
- MCP protocol specifications documented
- Integration points identified
- Data flows mapped
- Service boundaries defined

### ✅ Infrastructure Design Complete
- Core server infrastructure created
- Directory structure established
- Development environment configured
- All essential components implemented:
  - Express server with TypeScript
  - MCP protocol implementation
  - Service registry and handlers
  - Authentication & JWT support
  - Rate limiting per agent/service
  - Metrics collection (Prometheus)
  - Health monitoring endpoints
  - Command parser for slash commands
  - Error handling system
  - Structured logging
  - Environment configuration

### Ready for Service Implementation
**Status**: Infrastructure complete, awaiting GO signal for PostgreSQL MCP implementation

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js v20 + TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0
- **Container**: Docker Alpine
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Winston

### Security Model
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting per agent
- SSL/TLS via Let's Encrypt
- Network isolation
- Secrets management

## Blockers & Issues
- ✅ **RESOLVED: Cloudflare MCP** - API credentials configured and validated
- ✅ **RESOLVED: GitHub MCP** - GitHub App credentials (APP_ID, INSTALLATION_ID, PRIVATE_KEY) configured
- ✅ **RESOLVED: PostgreSQL** - Connection strings with correct ports (KA: 5432, OL: 5431)
- ✅ **RESOLVED: JWT_SECRET** - Secure 73-character key configured
- ✅ **RESOLVED: N8N** - API key configured
- ✅ **RESOLVED: Environment Loading** - Local .env strategy implemented with proper path resolution

**NO BLOCKING ISSUES REMAINING**

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` for local testing
4. Deploy with Coolify or Docker
5. Test all MCP services with slash commands
