## How Documentation is Generated

Documentation is automatically generated by the ADW (Autonomous Development Workflow) system during the **Document** phase:

1. **Project Detection**: ADW analyzes which files were changed and determines this is an admin project
2. **Documentation Generation**: The `/document` slash command creates comprehensive markdown docs
3. **Screenshot Capture**: UI screenshots are automatically captured and stored in `assets/`
4. **Conditional Docs Update**: New docs are registered in `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md`

## Documentation Format

Each feature document includes:
- **Overview**: What was built and why
- **Screenshots**: Visual representation of UI changes
- **Technical Implementation**: Files modified and key changes
- **How to Use**: Step-by-step usage instructions
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and settings
- **Testing**: How to test the feature

## Finding Documentation

Use `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md` to find relevant documentation based on:
- Feature area you're working on
- Specific functionality you're implementing
- Issues you're troubleshooting

## Contributing

Documentation is generated automatically by ADW workflows. To trigger documentation generation:

```bash
# Part of complete SDLC
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py <issue-number>

# Or standalone
uv run adws/adw_document_iso.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
```
